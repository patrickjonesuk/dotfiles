# My dotfiles.
## Not much here, but I'd rather not manually re-configure on each new system.
## Managed with my own tool: [MyCfg](https://github.com/pjones123/MyCfg)
## MyCfg is not a feature-rich or complex tool, but it does exactly what I need from a dotfile manager, which I could not find in any existing tool.

I'm hoping that I haven't managed to commit any secrets/keys here.
